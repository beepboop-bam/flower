Hi Sarah,

I didn't have the time to go buy you flowers and bring them to Berkeley so I thought of the next best thing! I hope you like it, I spent quite a bit of time on it so I really hope you like it. And don't worry, you still have another gift waiting for you. Anyways, I just wanted to say that you are the best thing to ever happen to me. I've been so much happier these past 2 years and quite literally love you so so sooo very much! I'm glad that I get to call you my best friend and keep you all to myself. I can't wait to keep telling you that I love you every single day and someday moving in to our very own place where we'll get to spend every second of the day with each other. I miss you so much and wish that we can be with each other everyday but we still have 2 years left :(. but until then just know that I'm thinking about you every second of my day.

I Love You,

Landon

p.s.: I did not write all of the code ðŸ˜…
